# Accounting
The program is designed for simple double-entry bookkeeping. The transactions are added as depit and credit to accounts two different accounts, which enables tracking of sources of income and expenditures. The plotting engine allows simple graphical visualizations of the money flows. The reporting system employing latex templates is still under development (and has been for 5 years, which means that it is probably not going to be finished any time soon).

Localization is not properly done, which means that the menus are all in Finnish.
